\begin{abstract}
We analyze log-data generated by an experiment using Cognitive Tutors for fractions. The experiment was performed to compare the educational outcomes for students presented with single and multiple graphical representations of fractions. We extract features characterizing problem-solving behavior and its evolution over time. We attempt to cluster the students participating in the experiment by their problem-solving behaviors, using extracted features as proxies. We then explore how these behaviors interact with the mode of representation, with a view to explaining how multiple representations improve learning outcomes. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Multiple graphical representations are used extensively in middle-school fraction instructions.  Fractions are alternately presented as pie and rectangle graphs, number lines and discrete sets of objects. The educational psychology literature suggests that multiple-representations support learning in a variety of ways, though the experimental results are not univocal [1]. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are uniquely suited for conducting experiments on the effect of multiple representations on learning outcomes. ITSs capture a significant amount of log data on how students interact with the tutoring system -- suggesting that machine learning methods could effectively discern the effectiveness of MGRs and the factors mediating their success. 

Classroom studies conducted on middle-school students working with ITSs found that multiple representations, in conjunction with self-explanation prompts, contribute to better learning outcomes [2]. Subsequent studies examining error-rate, hint-use and time-spent in ITS logs failed to identify variables that mediate the effectiveness of multiple representations [3]. The mechanisms by which multiple representations improve learning outcomes remain poorly understood.

We conjecture that previous efforts to identify mediating factors were frustrated by heterogeneity in the problem-solving habits and behaviors of the student population under investigation. We anticipate that clustering students by their patterns of interaction with the tutor will serve as an investigative wedge into the effectiveness of multiple representations. We propose two different flavors of clustering algorithms: $k$-means and latent class analysis. The former makes few assumptions but can be difficult to interpret. The latter makes some assumptions about the structure of the data, but offers easy methods to evaluate (specifically with respect to the number of latent classes) and interpret the models. Both algorithms produce clusters that are amenable to several interpretations. They could be identifying pre-existing learning dispositions in the student populations. In this case, we would expect a uniform distribution of representation conditions among the clusters. If the distribution of representation condition is significantly non-uniform, we can conclude that the clusters are identifying behaviors induced by their representation condition. Furthermore, if these clusters are predictive of learning outcome, we will have identified mediating factors for the effectiveness of multiple representations. 

\section{Experiment}
An experiment was conducted wherein 290 $4^{th}$ and $5^{th}$ grade students worked with an interactive Fractions Tutor for about 5 hours of their mathematics instruction. Students in the single representation condition worked with either a number line, a circle or a rectangle exclusively. Students in the multiple representation condition were presented with all three. Students interacted with the representations by dragging-and-dropping sections of the representation, using buttons to change the number of sections and by clicking on sections to highlight them. 

Students received a pretest on the day before they began working with the tutor and an immediate post-test on the day after they finished. Students also took a delayed post-test about a week after the first. Previous investigation found that students in the multiple representation condition significantly outperformed students in the single representation condition [3]. 

\section{Method}
Our analysis proceeds in three conceptual steps. We first reshape the transaction-level data and  extract problem and student-level metrics. We then run a $k$-means algorithm to identify clusters in the data, arriving at $k$ using BIC to score competing models. Additionally, to get another view of the data and to identify latent variables, we will run Latent Class Analysis (or Latent Profile Analysis). We are interested in the differences between these two models, specifically the number of classes of each best-fit model and the underlying clusters they represent.

Once we have clustered our data we investigate the interaction between the student clusters and their experimental conditions. We construct a contingency table binning the experimental conditions into the clusters constructed in the first stage of analysis. We then run a Fisher's exact test, using a null hypothesis of independence between the experimental condition and the student cluster. We thereby arrive at an exact $p$-level at which we can reject independence. 

In the third stage of analysis, we examine the relationship (independence vs.\ dependence) between the clusters and the outcomes of two post-tests using standard regression analysis. We then test for the independence of condition from outcome conditional on cluster membership to test whether we have identified mediators of the representation condition.

\subsection{Extracting Features}
The Cognitive Tutor captures a detailed log of the student's interactions with the tutor. It stores a time series of correct and incorrect answers, hint requests, interface selections and durations between interactions. We extract error and hint request rates, as well as average time spent per problem for each student. We exploit the time series by examining trends in error and hint-seeking behavior. To get a sense of the student's progression through the course, we fit a linear model of the number of hints requested and errors made to the number of problems completed. In order to characterize how the student responds when they are having difficulty with the material, we construct a matrix of transition probabilities out of an "Incorrect" state. That is, we compute the empirical probability of answering correctly, requesting a hint or answering incorrectly, conditional on having made a mistake. This serves as a proxy for stubbornness or willingness to seek help from the cognitive tutor. 

\subsection{Clustering}

In this section we describe Latent Class Analysis in some detail (we leave $k$-means for the final report). Additionally, this section will include the clusters we arrived at once the experiments are run.

\subsubsection{Latent Class Analysis}

Latent Class Analysis (LCA) is a latent variable modeling technique used widely in the behavioral and social sciences. LCA maps a set of categorical variables onto a set of inferred latent variables which are measured by observed variables. The model also makes a local independence assumption, meaning that the observed variables are independent conditional on the latent variable.

We note that the categorical nature of the model adds some noise, since we must select numeric cutoffs to transform some of our variables into nominals. Categorical models can offer greater interpretability by allowing us to organize our data into a small set of variables, which forms the basis for categorizing students into a small set of meaningful homogenous groups. Furthermore, it is not unreasonable to suspect that many of our variables are in some sense ``truly'' categorical.

Suppose that there are $j = 1 \ldots J$ observed variables, where each such variable $j$ has a set of response variables $r_{j} = 1,\ldots,R_{j}$. We can create a contingency table
\[ W = \prod_{j=1}^{j} R_{j}. \]
Each cell in $W$ corresponds to a response pattern $y = (r_{1},\ldots,r_{j})$. We let $Y$ be an array of response pattern, where each response pattern $y$ is associated with some probability $P(Y = y)$ with $\sum P(Y = y) = 1.$

Now, we need to consider the latent classes. Let $L$ be a latent variable with latent classes $c = 1,\ldots,C$. Furthermore, let $\gamma_{c}$ be the probability of membership in class $c$. Note that latent classes are exhaustive and mutually exclusive, so each student is a member of exactly one latent class. Formally,
\[ \sum_{c=1}^{C} \gamma_{c} = 1. \] 
We also need to define the item-response probability $\rho_{j,r_{j}|c}$, which is the probability of response $r_{j}$ to observed variable $j$, conditional on membership in latent class $c$. Note that 
\[ \sum_{r_{j}=1}^{R_{j}} \rho_{j,r_{j}|c} = 1 \] 
because each student provides exactly one response alternative to variable $j$. 

Now that we have defined key variables, we can define the probability of observing a particular response vector based on the $\gamma$'s and $\rho$'s:
\[
P(Y = y) = \sum_{c=1}^{C} \gamma_{c} \prod_{j=1}^{J} \prod_{r_{j}}^{R_{j}} \rho_{j,r_{j}|c}^{I(y_{j} = r_{j})}
\label{eqn:LCA-final}
\]
where the indicator function $I(y_{j} = r_{j})$ equals 1 when the response variable $j = r_{j}$. 

There are several measures of fit that we can use to select an appropriate number of latent classes. These include AIC (Akaike information criterion), BIC (Bayesian information criterion), and a $G^{2}$, the likelihood ratio statistic. Additionally, we can use a chi-square test statistic, though its interpretation is somewhat backwards from convention. The ``straw-man'' approach that the null hypothesis normally takes is not the convention in latent class analysis (or any structural equation modeling). Instead, the null hypothesis has some scientific value, so we usually hope that the null hypothesis is not rejected.

\subsection{Condition and Cluster Membership}

Once clusters have been established, we will use Fisher's exact test to determine cluster dependence or independence from condition. 

\subsection{Cluster Membership and Outcome}

We will also run a similar analysis to analyze independence of cluster membership with respect to outcome.

%\section{General formatting instructions}
%\label{gen_inst}
%
%The text must be confined within a rectangle 5.5~inches (33~picas) wide and
%9~inches (54~picas) long. The left margin is 1.5~inch (9~picas).
%Use 10~point type with a vertical spacing of 11~points. Times New Roman is the
%preferred typeface throughout. Paragraphs are separated by 1/2~line space,
%with no indentation.
%
%Paper title is 17~point, initial caps/lower case, bold, centered between
%2~horizontal rules. Top rule is 4~points thick and bottom rule is 1~point
%thick. Allow 1/4~inch space above and below title to rules. All pages should
%start at 1~inch (6~picas) from the top of the page.
%
%%The version of the paper submitted for review should have ``Anonymous Author(s)'' as the author of the paper.
%
%For the final version, authors' names are
%set in boldface, and each name is centered above the corresponding
%address. The lead author's name is to be listed first (left-most), and
%the co-authors' names (if different address) are set to follow. If
%there is only one co-author, list both author and co-author side by side.
%
%Please pay special attention to the instructions in section \ref{others}
%regarding figures, tables, acknowledgments, and references.
%
%\section{Headings: first level}
%\label{headings}
%
%First level headings are lower case (except for first word and proper nouns),
%flush left, bold and in point size 12. One line space before the first level
%heading and 1/2~line space after the first level heading.
%
%\subsection{Headings: second level}
%
%Second level headings are lower case (except for first word and proper nouns),
%flush left, bold and in point size 10. One line space before the second level
%heading and 1/2~line space after the second level heading.
%
%\subsubsection{Headings: third level}
%
%Third level headings are lower case (except for first word and proper nouns),
%flush left, bold and in point size 10. One line space before the third level
%heading and 1/2~line space after the third level heading.
%
%\section{Citations, figures, tables, references}
%\label{others}
%
%These instructions apply to everyone, regardless of the formatter being used.
%
%\subsection{Citations within the text}
%
%Citations within the text should be numbered consecutively. The corresponding
%number is to appear enclosed in square brackets, such as [1] or [2]-[5]. The
%corresponding references are to be listed in the same order at the end of the
%paper, in the \textbf{References} section. (Note: the standard
%\textsc{Bib\TeX} style \texttt{unsrt} produces this.) As to the format of the
%references themselves, any style is acceptable as long as it is used
%consistently.
%
%As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the 
%third person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et al.\ [4]'',
%not ``In our previous work [4]''. If you cite your other papers that
%are not widely available (e.g.\ a journal paper under review), use
%anonymous author names in the citation, e.g.\ an author of the
%form ``A.\ Anonymous''. 
%
%
%\subsection{Footnotes}
%
%Indicate footnotes with a number\footnote{Sample of the first footnote} in the
%text. Place the footnotes at the bottom of the page on which they appear.
%Precede the footnote with a horizontal rule of 2~inches
%(12~picas).\footnote{Sample of the second footnote}
%
%\subsection{Figures}
%
%All artwork must be neat, clean, and legible. Lines should be dark
%enough for purposes of reproduction; art work should not be
%hand-drawn. The figure number and caption always appear after the
%figure. Place one line space before the figure caption, and one line
%space after the figure. The figure caption is lower case (except for
%first word and proper nouns); figures are numbered consecutively.
%
%Make sure the figure caption does not get separated from the figure.
%Leave sufficient space to avoid splitting the figure and figure caption.
%
%You may use color figures. 
%However, it is best for the
%figure captions and the paper body to make sense if the paper is printed
%either in black/white or in color.
%\begin{figure}[h]
%\begin{center}
%%\framebox[4.0in]{$\;$}
%\fbox{\rule[-.5cm]{0cm}{4cm} \rule[-.5cm]{4cm}{0cm}}
%\end{center}
%\caption{Sample figure caption.}
%\end{figure}
%
%\subsection{Tables}
%
%All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible. Do not use hand-drawn
%tables. The table number and title always appear before the table. See
%Table~\ref{sample-table}.
%
%Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the table
%title, and one line space after the table. The table title must be lower case
%(except for first word and proper nouns); tables are numbered consecutively.
%
%\begin{table}[t]

%Soma             &Cell body (contains cell nucleus) \\
%\end{tabular}
%\end{center}
%\end{table}
%
%\section{Final instructions}
%Do not change any aspects of the formatting parameters in the style files.
%In particular, do not modify the width or length of the rectangle the text
%should fit into, and do not change font sizes (except perhaps in the
%\textbf{References} section; see below). Please note that pages should be
%numbered.
%
%\section{Preparing PostScript or PDF files}
%
%Please prepare PostScript or PDF files with paper size ``US Letter'', and
%not, for example, ``A4''. The -t
%letter option on dvips will produce US Letter files.
%
%Fonts were the main cause of problems in the past years. Your PDF file must
%only contain Type 1 or Embedded TrueType fonts. Here are a few instructions
%to achieve this.
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item You can check which fonts a PDF files uses.  In Acrobat Reader,
%select the menu Files$>$Document Properties$>$Fonts and select Show All Fonts. You can
%also use the program \verb+pdffonts+ which comes with \verb+xpdf+ and is
%available out-of-the-box on most Linux machines.
%
%\item The IEEE has recommendations for generating PDF files whose fonts
%are also acceptable for NIPS. Please see
%http://www.emfield.org/icuwb2010/downloads/IEEE-PDF-SpecV32.pdf
%
%\item LaTeX users:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item Consider directly generating PDF files using \verb+pdflatex+
%(especially if you are a MiKTeX user). 
%PDF figures must be substituted for EPS figures, however.
%
%\item Otherwise, please generate your PostScript and PDF files with the following commands:
%\begin{verbatim} 
%dvips mypaper.dvi -t letter -Ppdf -G0 -o mypaper.ps
%ps2pdf mypaper.ps mypaper.pdf
%\end{verbatim}
%
%Check that the PDF files only contains Type 1 fonts. 
%%For the final version, please send us both the Postscript file and
%%the PDF file. 
%
%\item xfig "patterned" shapes are implemented with 
%bitmap fonts.  Use "solid" shapes instead. 
%\item The \verb+\bbold+ package almost always uses bitmap
%fonts.  You can try the equivalent AMS Fonts with command
%\begin{verbatim}
%\usepackage[psamsfonts]{amssymb}
%\end{verbatim}
% or use the following workaround for reals, natural and complex: 
%\begin{verbatim}
%\newcommand{\RR}{I\!\!R} %real numbers
%\newcommand{\Nat}{I\!\!N} %natural numbers 
%\newcommand{\CC}{I\!\!\!\!C} %complex numbers
%\end{verbatim}
%
%\item Sometimes the problematic fonts are used in figures
%included in LaTeX files. The ghostscript program \verb+eps2eps+ is the simplest
%way to clean such figures. For black and white figures, slightly better
%results can be achieved with program \verb+potrace+.
%\end{itemize}
%\item MSWord and Windows users (via PDF file):
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Install the Microsoft Save as PDF Office 2007 Add-in from
%http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en\&familyid=4d951911-3e7e-4ae6-b059-a2e79ed87041
%\item Select ``Save or Publish to PDF'' from the Office or File menu
%\end{itemize}
%\item MSWord and Mac OS X users (via PDF file):
%\begin{itemize}
%\item From the print menu, click the PDF drop-down box, and select ``Save
%as PDF...''
%\end{itemize}
%\item MSWord and Windows users (via PS file):
%\begin{itemize}
%\item To create a new printer
%on your computer, install the AdobePS printer driver and the Adobe Distiller PPD file from
%http://www.adobe.com/support/downloads/detail.jsp?ftpID=204 {\it Note:} You must reboot your PC after installing the
%AdobePS driver for it to take effect.
%\item To produce the ps file, select ``Print'' from the MS app, choose
%the installed AdobePS printer, click on ``Properties'', click on ``Advanced.''
%\item Set ``TrueType Font'' to be ``Download as Softfont''
%\item Open the ``PostScript Options'' folder
%\item Select ``PostScript Output Option'' to be ``Optimize for Portability''
%\item Select ``TrueType Font Download Option'' to be ``Outline''
%\item Select ``Send PostScript Error Handler'' to be ``No''
%\item Click ``OK'' three times, print your file.
%\item Now, use Adobe Acrobat Distiller or ps2pdf to create a PDF file from
%the PS file. In Acrobat, check the option ``Embed all fonts'' if
%applicable.
%\end{itemize}
%
%\end{itemize}
%If your file contains Type 3 fonts or non embedded TrueType fonts, we will
%ask you to fix it. 
%
%\subsection{Margins in LaTeX}
% 
%Most of the margin problems come from figures positioned by hand using
%\verb+\special+ or other commands. We suggest using the command
%\verb+\includegraphics+
%from the graphicx package. Always specify the figure width as a multiple of
%the line width as in the example below using .eps graphics
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx} ... 
%   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.eps} 
%\end{verbatim}
%or % Apr 2009 addition
%\begin{verbatim}
%   \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} ... 
%   \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{myfile.pdf} 
%\end{verbatim}
%for .pdf graphics. 
%See section 4.4 in the graphics bundle documentation (http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/grfguide.ps) 
% 
%A number of width problems arise when LaTeX cannot properly hyphenate a
%line. Please give LaTeX hyphenation hints using the \verb+\-+ command.
%
